# 🌐 BlockForge: A Comprehensive Blockchain Implementation

## 🚀 Project Overview

BlockForge is a custom blockchain implementation that demonstrates the core principles of blockchain technology, built from the ground up using Node.js and Express.js. This project serves as an educational journey into the world of decentralized technology, showcasing the intricate mechanics behind blockchain systems.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔒 Robust Security Mechanisms
- **Proof of Work Algorithm**: Implements a sophisticated proof of work system
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: Ensures data integrity and immutability
- **Chain Validation**: Comprehensive blockchain integrity checks

### 🧱 Blockchain Fundamentals
- **Genesis Block Creation**: Initiates the blockchain with a foundational block
- **Dynamic Block Addition**: Seamlessly add new blocks with unique identifiers
- **Nonce-Based Mining**: Simulate the block mining process

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

### Blockchain Components
- **Block Class**: 
  - Stores block metadata (index, timestamp, data)
  - Generates unique cryptographic hashes
  - Implements proof of work mechanism

- **Blockchain Class**:
  - Manages the entire chain of blocks
  - Handles block addition and validation
  - Configurable mining difficulty

### 🌈 Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Web Framework**: Express.js
- **Cryptography**: Node.js Crypto Library
- **Hashing**: SHA-256

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Block Management
- `POST /createBlock`: 
  - Endpoint to create and add new blocks
  - Supports arbitrary data insertion
  - Automatically applies proof of work

- `GET /getLatestBlock`: 
  - Retrieve the most recently added block
  - Provides instant access to the latest blockchain state

- `GET /verifyChain`: 
  - Comprehensive blockchain integrity check
  - Returns boolean validity status

- `GET /printChain`: 
  - Full blockchain visualization
  - Displays entire chain structure

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- npm (v6+)

### Installation Steps
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/VanshGoyal000/BlockForge.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd BlockForge

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the blockchain server
node server.js
```

## 🔍 How It Works

### Blockchain Creation
1. Generates a genesis block
2. Allows dynamic block addition
3. Implements proof of work with configurable difficulty

### Proof of Work
- Mining difficulty set to 4 leading zeros
- Nonce incrementation until hash meets difficulty criteria
- Prevents rapid block creation

## 🌟 Use Cases
- Educational blockchain demonstration
- Cryptocurrency prototyping
- Understanding distributed ledger fundamentals
- Technical interview preparation

## 📚 Learning Objectives
- Blockchain architecture
- Cryptographic hashing
- Consensus mechanisms
- Distributed system design
